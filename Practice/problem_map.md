# Problem Map
The following is a "problem map" for all the files in this folder. This is so it is possible to reference the Kattis site in order to build competitions off of the list of problems already completed.

It is important to note that the ```.in```, ```.out```, and ```.ans``` file extensions are reserved specifically for inputs, outputs, and answer files respectively. If there are multiple inputs/outputs/answers, the file will look like ```{filename}_1.in```, 1 being the number that it corresponds to.

The chart below will denote the following:
* *Date*: Date of completion
* *Name*: Name of the prompt in kattis; this will be a hyperlink to the original kattis problem
* *Filename*: Name of the file in this folder
* *Problem ID*: Problem ID is the problem ID that would be used in 
* *Kattis Level*: Problem Difficulty in Kattis
