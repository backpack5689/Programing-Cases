# Programing-Cases
These are all the programming problems that I have completed.

For any folder that is in this "Programming-Cases" github, it is safe to assume that the problems/solutions included in this folder are from Kattis. Kattis is a platform in which you can, not only practice programming problems, but also host competitions.

Every folder is from either a hosted competition, or a competed-in competition, except the "Practice" folder. A hosted competition will contain a "manifest.md" file, containing the information, chosen problems, and a solution to each, along with the competition members and any other information needed to host the event. If I had competed in the competiton, it will have the same "manifest.md" file, however, this will not contain the other event members. Just the problems that I completed and their prompts.

The "Practice" folder contains all completed practice problem solutions, and any ```.in```, ```.out```, and ```.ans``` as needed. It also contains a ```problem_map.md``` file, which has each problem link in kattis, difficulty levels, and other items. This is to help with the creation of programming competitions  with a catalog of already completed solutions to the problems.
